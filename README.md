## Math Game Quiz

Math Game Quiz is a small project I've moderately customized as I've followed along a [Udemy's Web Development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-web-development-course/) in 2019.

### How it works
* Open the game [here](https://cdpn.io/boglarkasebestyen/debug/PoNpQGg/vPMKKgeeaNGM). 
* Press Start Game.
* A timer will begin that will count back from 60. 
* Multiply the numbers as fast as you can by choosing the right answer from the given boxes. 
* If you fail, you can try again as long as you don't run out of time.
* If you do lose, you can start the game from the beginning. 
* You can reset the game at any point throughout the course of the game.
* You'll also be able to see your score on the top right corner which will indicate how many times you've chosen the correct answer.
